All of the algorithms were written in C++. Please use an IDE that can read C++ and has a C++ compiler. 
We used VS Code to write and compile our programs. If you run into problems compiling it through VS Code, 
then run it with the ‘Developer Command Prompt for VS’. In the command prompt, navigate to the folder where the code is in your computer, 
then enter “code .” without the quotation marks to open the project in VS Code. This should allow you to compile and run each program.

Each program operates through user input through a command prompt or terminal. Once a program is run, 
instructions will be provided for step by step instructions for the user to follow. 
Each program is equipped to run any inputs, as long as the input remains within the bounds of the instructions, 
without the need to make changes to the coding as there are no limitations from use of constant variables. 
For steps which instruct the user to provide a series of inputs, it will ask to separate individual inputs with a comma. 
For example, if the user inputs the numbers one, two, and three, they will input it as: “1, 2, 3”, followed by the enter key to progress.
